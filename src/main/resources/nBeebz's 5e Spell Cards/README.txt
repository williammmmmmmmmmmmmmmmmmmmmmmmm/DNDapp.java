Dungeon's & Dragons 5th Edition Spell Cards - By nBeebz - Version 1.3 (2021-11-18)
=======================================================
Hi there, I hope you enjoy using these spell cards as much as I enjoyed making them!
If you have any questions not answered here you can find me on reddit (u/nbeebz/) or twitter (@mrthenbeebz)

About the Cards
---------------
These cards were lovingly made to solve the problem of players (both new and old) having to deal with the hundereds of spells available to them.
I wanted to make it easy to organize and sort these spells, while also adding a fun physical element to the game.

Almost every bit of important information has been included on the cards:
- Name, level, and spell school (colour coded).
- Range, duration, casting time.
- Components needed (verbal, somatic, material) denoted by icons.
- An icon indicating if the spell can be ritual-casted.
- Full rules text, or as much as could fit.
- Page references.

Some info may not be readily apparent:
- Spells which need concentration have an icon next to their duration.
- Cards which have a gold cost associated with the material component have this cost noted next to the material icon.
- If the material cost has an asterisk, you must pay this cost for every casting of the spell.
- Cards whose text had to be edited to fit have an asterisk next to their page reference. In such cases, every effort was made to keep the relevant rules intact.
- The flavour text is purely cosmetic, and should not be taken as part of the rules of the spell.


Using the Cards
---------------
These cards are designed to be printed professionally, but should come out fine on most home printers.
I used [Printer Studio](http://www.printerstudio.ca/customized/custom-playing-cards-gifts.html) to print them.
If you want to print your cards with a back, both the cardback I used and simple printer-friendly version are included.

Some ideas for using them that I found effective:
- Using a card sleeve sheet to create an actual "spellbook".
- Keeping your "spells prepared" on hand, and discarding them as you use up spell slots.
- One-time-use spell scrolls as player rewards.
- Keeping the images as easy references on a phone or tablet.


Using the Templates
-------------------
Included also are the templates used to generate the cards, one for each spell school. 
These are .psd files and you will need Photoshop to use them. 
Make sure to install the fonts included in the templates folder if you want yours to look like the original design:

Ringbearer - Title font
MPlantin - Labels, rules text
MPlantin Bold - Range, duration, casting time
MPlantin Italic - Flavour text

Each spell school has its own template which styles the card accordingly.
You are free to fill in the information by hand, but included in the templates are variables which allow you to generate cards using a .csv file. An example .csv file has been provided in the templates folder.

This file must have ALL the following 21 fields:

name = Name of the spell 
level = Level indicator
details = Range, duration, cast time (each on one line)
flavour = Flavour text
description = Rules text
page = Page reference
cost = Gold cost of the material component (if any)

These fields are all TRUE/FALSE:

bard = In the bard spell list
cleric = In the cleric spell list
druid = In the druid spell list
paladin = In the paladin spell list
ranger = In the ranger spell list
sorcerer = In the sorcerer spell list
warlock = In the warlock spell list
wizard = In the wizard spell list
concentration = Requires concentration
somatic = Requires a somatic component
verbal = Requires a verbal component
material = Requires a material component
gp = The spell's material component has a gold cost
ritual = The spell can be ritual casted

To load the .csv file go to Image -> Apply Data Set... in Photoshop.
